## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

Well this was the one i almost completed on my own, but i got stuck in making the container center of the page, that made me look for tutorial, but this was my fastest project, now i learned the hover effect completedly.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
